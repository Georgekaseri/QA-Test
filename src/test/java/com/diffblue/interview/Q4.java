   /* To perform a manual test of the main application included in this example (ExampleApplication#main), I would consider the following inputs:

A valid Java file path that contains code for which we want to generate a test coverage report.
An invalid Java file path to see if the application handles the error message correctly.
No arguments to ensure that the application prompts the user to provide a file path.
A Java file that contains no code to see if the application handles empty files correctly.
When running the application, I would look for the following behaviors:

The application should exit with an error message if the user does not provide a file path or if the file does not exist.
The application should generate a test coverage report for the specified Java file.
The application should display the code contents and denote the covered lines of code with an 'X'.
The application should handle empty files and files with only comments by correctly displaying the file contents with no coverage report.
Overall, I would ensure that the application behaves correctly in all expected and unexpected scenarios, and provides a useful test coverage report for the provided Java file.*/
